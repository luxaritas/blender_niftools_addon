   It would be a good habit to document every feature we have, and quick instructions for how to use them.
   
   Split this up into separate files mimicking test framework structure.

All the features of our Blender Niftools addon are described here.

If in need of a guide to make sure your model is complete please visit the :ref:`workflow page <user-workflow>`.

.. warning::
   Please note that some are still being ported from Blender 2.49b and are marked appropriately.
